# ðŸŸ¢ Obstacle Avoiding cum RC Robot
This is a simple Arduino based robot which uses an ultrasonic distance sensor and a bluetooth module for its 
obstacle avoiding and remote control functionality respectively.

As I am not into app development for now, I used MIT App inventor to create my app :)

My circuit was pretty much same as above, difference being that I used 4 motors instead of two and I used two sets of batteries, one to power the arduino and the other to power the servo. I did this to
prevent the Arduino from the back emf that is being generated by the servo motor which might interfere with the other pwm signals. It might also lead to the failure of Arduino.
